            <p>Eden Gardens in Kolkata, India has a pitch that is generally <strong>Batting-friendly</strong>. The pitches are usually made from black cotton soil, which helps to maintain bounce. The pitch also offers a fair amount of turn and bounce to spinners. This type of soil helps in maintaining good bounce, which can make batting conditions more favourable. However, as the <i>match progresses</i> it becomes slow, which could <strong>favour spinners.</strong></p>
