            <p>The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad, India has a batting-friendly pitch that favors fast bowlers over spinners. The flat surface provides good bounce and carry for batters.The pitch isn't low and slow like the pitches in Kolkata and Chennai but definitely favors the bowlers. Pacers often take more wickets here than the spinners but spinners prove to be more economical.
            Average first-innings winning score is 169.8.</p>
